    name: Left shutter
    buttons_position: left
    title_position: bottom
    outside_window: show
    outside_window_pic: /local/community/pic-shutter-card/my_outside_window.png

## Modification

There are 4 files in the folder where `hass-shutter-card` is installed:

| File | Description
| ---- | -----------
| frame_window.png | window frame (transparent background in the center)
| outside_window.png | view outside the window
| sc_shutter_bottom.png | lower stick on the curtain cloth
| sc_shutter_slide.png | the picture from which the curtain canvas is built by repetition (the picture has a size of 1x6 pin (the upper 4 are white, the lower ones have a gradient in transparency). If you make a picture of 1x20 pix, where the top 10 pix are filled with color, and the bottom 10 pix are transparent, then you get a day-night curtain)

You can replace the pictures to get a new design (3 sample).

Additionally, you can edit using the Home Assistant.
Insert the CSS code in the card code below to redefine the card style.

(If it doesn't work, then install an additional card-mod extension.
In HACS in the User Interface, find in the search and install.
Repository - https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod ).

If you are not going to redefine something, then do not insert lines to change the properties of the CSS class.
Example:
```yaml
.sc-shutter-label {                               # Class name
font-size: 15px !IMPORTANT;                       # Font size change string
}                                                 # Closing parenthesis 
```

## css code for changing the card:

```yaml
style: |
  ha-card {
    font-size: 15px !IMPORTANT;                   # Font size for the value %
  }
  .sc-shutter-label {
    font-size: 15px !IMPORTANT;                   # Font size for the name of the curtain
  }
  .card-header {
    font-size: 20px !IMPORTANT;                   # Font size for the card name
    line-height: 20px !IMPORTANT;                 # The height of the line for the card name
    text-align: center !IMPORTANT;                # Alignment of the card name: left center right
  }
  .sc-shutter-selector-slide {

    background-image: none !IMPORTANT;            # Disabling the picture for the canvas, a colored background is displayed
  }
  .sc-shutter-outside-window {
    width: 88% !IMPORTANT;                        # Width of the view image outside the window
    height: 90% !IMPORTANT;                       # The height of the picture of the view outside the window
  }
  .sc-shutter-selector-picker {
    width: 82% !IMPORTANT;                        # The width of the picture of the lower shelf on the curtain canvas
    background-size: 100% 6px;                    # For stretching the bottom stick, not cropping, when changing the width.
  }                                               # If you changed the height of the stick image, then change 6px to your height
  .frame-window {
    width: 100px !IMPORTANT;                      # Width of the window frame picture
    height: 150px;                                # The height of the picture of the window frame. Without it, it scales, not shrinks
  }
  .sc-shutter-selector-picture {
    width: 100px !IMPORTANT;                      # The width of the entire window, from which % of the stick, canvas and view outside the window is considered
  }
  .sc-shutter-middle {
    width: 155px !IMPORTANT;                      # The width of the window with control buttons. Equal to the sum of their width
  }
```
